      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>
        If you have two children and would like the babysitter to stay for 4
        hours while also preparing meals and doing light housekeeping tasks, the
        total cost would be calculated as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Base rate for two children: </li>

        <li>
          $20 per hour Additional services: $5 per hour for meal preparation +
          $10 per hour for light housekeeping tasks = $15 per hour
        </li>

        <li>Total hourly rate: $20 + $15 = $35 per hour</li>

        <li>4-hour booking: $35 per hour x 4 hours = $140</li>

        <li>
          10% discount for booking 4 or more consecutive hours: $140 x 10% = $14
        </li>

        <li>Total cost: $140 - $14 = $126 </li>
      </ul>
